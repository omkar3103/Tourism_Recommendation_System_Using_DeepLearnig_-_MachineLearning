# 🌍 Tourism Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview
The Tourism Recommendation System is an AI-based project that suggests travel destinations based on user preferences. The system focuses on providing personalized recommendations by analyzing factors such as destination type, budget, season, and activities.

Initially, a traditional machine learning content-based filtering approach was implemented. To improve accuracy and overcome limitations of the ML model, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was later integrated using the same feature set.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Recommend suitable tourist destinations to users
- Provide personalized travel suggestions
- Improve recommendation accuracy using ANN
- Build a scalable and efficient recommendation model

## 🧠 Approach
1. **Dataset Creation**
   - Custom dataset generated with features like:
     - Destination type
     - Budget
     - Season
     - Activities
     - Location

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature encoding
   - Normalization and scaling

3. **Machine Learning Model**
   - Content-based filtering
   - Similarity-based recommendations

4. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**
   - Used to overcome limitations of ML model
   - Improved accuracy and better generalization
   - Same dataset features used for training

5. **Recommendation Output**
   - Displays personalized destination recommendations based on user input
